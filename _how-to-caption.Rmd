## Add a table caption

You can add a caption to your table with the `caption` parameter. This lets you 
put your caption in a character string, and it will be added to the table output:

```{r}
top_10_data %>% 
  kable(booktabs = TRUE, col.names = c("State", "Total Pertussis Cases"),
        caption = "States with most total cases of Pertussis") 
```

The captions will be numbered based on their order in the document. If you're 
building a fancier document (like the `bookdown` book we've created here), the 
table numbering will start with the chapter's number and then given the number of the 
table within that chapter.
