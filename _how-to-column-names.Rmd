## Change column names

By default, each column will have the same name as the column name in the data
that is input to `kable`. You can easily change those, though, with the 
`col.names` option. You just put in a character vector with as many values as you 
have columns, giving the names you would prefer:

```{r echo = 1:2}
top_10_data %>% 
  kable(booktabs = TRUE, col.names = c("State", "Total Pertussis Cases")) 
```
