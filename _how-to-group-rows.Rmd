## Group rows

You might also want to show structure or grouping within your rows. There
are a number of functions in `kableExtra` that help with this. 

These examples will again use data derived from the "us_contagious_diseases" data
from the `dslabs` package. The following code will load that data and then create the
`per_hepa_latest_years` dataframe from it:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
data("us_contagious_diseases")

per_hepa_latest_years <- us_contagious_diseases %>% 
  # Limit to states in the region of interest
  filter(state %in% c("California", "Oregon", "Washington")) %>% 
  # Limit to the two diseases of interest
  filter(disease %in% c("Pertussis", "Hepatitis A")) %>% 
  # Limit to the latest five years reported for each combination of 
  # state and disease
  group_by(state, disease) %>% 
  arrange(desc(year)) %>%
  slice(1:5) %>%
  # Calculate the average weekly count from the total yearly count and
  # the number of weeks reporting (should check data---does an 
  # 'unreported' week mean there were no cases that week?)
  mutate(ave_weekly_count = count / weeks_reporting) %>%
  # Limit to only the data to show in the table
  select(state, disease, year, ave_weekly_count) %>% 
  # Reorder by year so that the earliest year comes first
  arrange(disease, state, year) %>% 
  # "Widen" the data for a nicer table
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = ave_weekly_count)
```
